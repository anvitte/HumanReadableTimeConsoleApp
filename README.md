# Objective 1

Write a command-line program that returns the current time using the "Human Friendly Text"demonstrated in the example below. Numeric Time Human Friendly Text

• 1:00 One o'clock

• 2:00 Two o'clock

• 13:00 One o'clock

• 13:05 Five past one

• 13:10 Ten past one

• 13:25 Twenty five past one

• 13:30 Half past one

• 13:35 Twenty five to two

• 13:55 Five to two

For example, if we execute this program at 16:30, it should output "Half past four"

C:\ ..some command..

Half past four

# Objective 2

Allow the command to take an arbitrary Numeric Time parameter as input and return the "Human Friendly Text" equivalent.

For example:

C:\ ..some command.. 15:00

Three o'clock

I used Humanizer Package to convert the Numbers into Human Readable format
